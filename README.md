# PC Setup Scripts
Scripts to set up a work environment on different platforms

## Elementary Setup
The elementary folder contains a bash script to set up all the applications via apt. As a bonus, it also contains a raspberry pi set up script as a basic docker server.

## Windows Setup
The Windows setup uses chocolatey, the closes alternative package manager for Windows. Install.ps1 powerscript should be run first, this would set up the powershell config and install chocolatey. Afterwards run chocolatey-setup.ps1.
